# Banking Application Automation Testing

This project automates testing for a banking application using Selenium WebDriver and TestNG. It covers various features such as user registration, bill payment, fund transfer,
loan requests, and updating contact information.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- Maven installed
- Chrome WebDriver installed (or any other WebDriver compatible with your browser)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:https://github.com/Ahmed-Rakha/banking-automation.git
2.  Navigate to the project directory:https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm
3.  Install dependencies: selenium-java & testng & javafaker & log4j-core & mysql-connector-j & jetbrains
4.  Update the DATABASE CONFIG  with appropriate configurations like the JDBC_URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/Para_Bank";  DB_USERNAME = "root"; DB_PASSWORD = "password";


## Techniques Used

### Design Patterns:

- **Page Object Model (POM):** The project follows the POM design pattern, organizing page objects separately from test logic for better maintainability and reusability.

- **Fluent Design Pattern:** Fluent interfaces are used in some page object methods to provide a more readable and expressive API for interacting with web elements.

- **Facade Pattern:** A facade pattern is applied through an EndToEndFacade class, providing a simplified interface for executing a sequence of related actions in an end-to-end test scenario.

### Techniques:

- **Data-Driven Testing:** Test data is separated from test logic using TestNG's DataProvider, allowing easy modification and reuse of test cases with different input data.

- **Assertions:** TestNG assertions are used to verify expected outcomes and ensure the application behaves as expected.

- **Explicit Waits:** WebDriverWait is used for explicit waits, ensuring synchronization between test steps and elements' visibility or availability.

- **Logging:** Logging is implemented using Log4j2 to capture and report errors, warnings, and other relevant information during test execution.
  
- **MySQL Database Integration:** The project integrates with a MySQL database using a DatabaseConnector class. This allows storing and retrieving data from the database,
    such as inserting bill payment information.

- **DataGenerator:** The DataGenerator class is used to generate test data for various test scenarios, such as user registration and bill payment. It ensures that test data
    is consistent and can be generated dynamically, enhancing test coverage and reliability.

## Test Reports

After running the tests, find the test reports generated by TestNG in the `target/surefire-reports` directory. These reports provide detailed information about test results
including passed tests, failed tests, and overall statistics.

## Project Structure

The project follows this structure:

* src
    * main
        * java (contains source code)
            * POM_Pages (Page Object Model classes)
            * Test_Cases (Test classes)
    * test
        * java (contains test code)
            * POM_Pages (Page Object Model classes)
            * Test_Cases (Test classes)
* target (contains compiled code and generated reports)
* config.properties (configuration file)
* pom.xml (Maven project configuration)
* README.md (this file)
